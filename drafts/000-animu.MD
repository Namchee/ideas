## Summary

Animu is a desktop personal assistant to help you keep track of your favorite anime releases. On any new releases, it will send you a notification. Never miss any new episodes from your favorite title again!

> ⚠️ Note: This app **WILL NOT** provide streaming service! Probably will just link the episode to official channels.

## Motivation

This idea is proposed by a friend of mine.

It also acts as a leeway to learn about ServiceWorkers

## Stack

Definitely a fully front-end app. The notification part can be done with [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification).

> UPDATE 10/4/2020: This feature is only supported in modern browsers!

Still debating between Vue or Svelte. In the end, I'll pick Svelte.

## Current Progress

- UI Design, you can see the progress [here](https://www.figma.com/file/JjrSY8LAea8gyyKPqVBMh8/animu?node-id=0%3A1)
- Currently suspended until `svelte@next` is mature.
