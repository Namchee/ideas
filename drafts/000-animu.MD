## Summary

Animu is a desktop personal assistant to help you keep track of your favorite anime releases. On any new releases, it will send you a notification. Never miss any new episodes from your favorite title again!

> ⚠️ Note: This app **WILL NOT** provide streaming service! Probably will just link the episode to official channels.

## Motivation

This idea is proposed by a friend of mine.

## Stack

Definitely a fully front-end app. The notification part can be done with [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification).

Still debating between Vue or Svelte.

## Current Progress

- UI Design
