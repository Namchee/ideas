# Drafts

Drafts are ideas that haven't been planned and or doesn't have concrete implementation yet. You can say that drafts are concept of something.

Drafts may come from random idea that pops out of nowhere, my daily development rants, and suggested by a friend.

Drafts has 4 cycles:

- Pending. Any ideas starts with this phase. Ideas that have pending status usually still lacks detail in some aspect or I'm just still thiking it over.
- In Progress. Currently Work In Progress some other repository. **May be rejected in the future**.
- Finished. Ideas that have concrete implementation and (mostly) finished.
- Rejected. Ideas that have been dropped due to various reason. The reason is stated on the markdown file.
