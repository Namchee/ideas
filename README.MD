### Drafts

Drafts are ideas that haven't been planned and or doesn't have concrete implementation yet. Drafts may come from random idea that pops out of nowhere, my daily development rants, and suggested by a friend.

More info at [drafts folder](drafts).

UPDATE 9/1/2021: A draft MAY BE written in local language, depending on the scope.
